# businessPlanR

The `businessPlanR` package is the result of the [Cultural Commons Collecting Societyâ€™s (C3S)](https://www.c3s.cc) need for a comprehensive business plan. We hope that the package has remained generic enough for others to find it useful.

For more information on `businessPlanR`, please see the comprehensive vignette.
